    "A single decision tree does not perform well as it tends to overfit.  A possible solution is the construct multiple trees to reduce variances.  To make sure each tree is not exactly learning the same thing since it will then be all same trees, we need to inject some differences to these trees (i.e., make them as diverse as possible but at the same time they also see some overlappinp samples).  One simple idea is that each of the tree is trained on a subset of **bootstrapping sample** and then perform some sort of aggregation of the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample $m$ times **with replacement** from the original training data\n",
    "2. Repeat $B$ times to generate $B$ \"boostrapped\" training datasets $D_1, D_2, \\cdots, D_B$\n",
    "3. Train $B$ trees using the training datasets $D_1, D_2, \\cdots, D_B$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Boostrapping the data plus performing some sort of aggregation (averaging or majority votes) is called **boostrap aggregation** or **bagging**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we have a training set where $m=4$, and $n=2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D = {(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We generate, say, $B = 3$ datasets by boostrapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_1 = {(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_3, y_3)}$$\n",
    "$$D_2 = {(x_1, y_1), (x_4, y_4), (x_4, y_4), (x_3, y_3)}$$\n",
    "$$D_3 = {(x_1, y_1), (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_2, y_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then train 3 trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When sampling is performed **without** replacement, it is called **pasting**.  In other words, both bagging and pasting allow training instances to be sampled several times across multiple predictors, but only bagging allows training instances to be sampled several times for the same predictor.\n",
